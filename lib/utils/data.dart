Yarns of various textures, colors and diameters have been made and wool from goats and sheep have also been researched on. Their properties, features and pros and cons have been looked at in light of the regional conditions of Barrah.\nFollowing the process of shearing, washing and brushing fibres, yarns of differing types have been produced and different tones of fibres have been created by mixing them during the brushing process. A multitude of shades ranging from browns, greys and tonal beiges have been made and a neutral color palette has been achieved. The women who are spinning the yarns weren't aware of the multiple possibilities of mixing and creating a unique color palette and with this practice and design intervention, their expertise has been influenced in a unique way. Some of the thicker yarns made are an ideal option for knitting which isn’t practised in the region. Yarns made by mixing goat hair and sheep wool has also been achieved since the goat hair is very wispy and the wool ensures the yarns are not too fibrous and keeps it strong. "

Wool is a common material in such mountainous areas, and the production of yarn from sheep's wool is a traditional craft in many communities. Different regions may have specific techniques and styles unique to their cultural traditions. The people in Barrah Village have been practising yarn making as a generational craft, honing their skills with time and practice. The women’s expertise in yarn making has evolved over the years and now they are able to teach not only their daughters but also the women of neighbouring villages and communities too.

            "Regional wool has been used and handspinning skills have been practised for generations in families. Wool from sheep, lambs and the pashmina bearing goats are all native to Baltistan and yarns of varying qualities can be made. The wool is either sourced from the people who keep the domesticated animals or from markets where local inhabitants sell raw wool in large quantities. The gojali goat which is the pashmina bearing goat can be found in the lofty mountains of gilgit-Baltistan. The fleece (or pashm in Persian) is grown under the long coarse hair of the goat and it protects against the harsh cold climate. In the months of February and March, the fleece is combed out by herdsmen who sell it in markets all over the region. Yarns made from the pashmina goats are of finer quality as compared to yarns made from sheep wool.\nCarding brushes, spindles, spindle whorls and whorls have been used to make yarns by hand. It is a time taking process and it requires considerable patience and strength as well. The process of brushing and separating the fibres by hand requires focus and hand strength as well and those gestures and movements have become a part of their practice. Practice has perfected the art form and this ancient way of spinning fibre into yarn has been preserved and sustained over thousands of years. "

        "text":
            "The practice of making yarn has been conserved by the communities that have been involved with the craft for many years. The practice is based on familial teaching (ustaad-shaagird) and the crafts and skills are passed down from generations. Women sitting together in the daylight, separating, brushing and mixing fibres are all doing it over conversations and discussions. They also move and sit according to the direction of the sun, so that they receive maximum warmth and light during the day. This has become a form of routine for the women in the northern areas and remote villages. Spinning yarn is a communal effort as much as it is an individual effort.\nConservation of this practice is also ensured by the resources used. For instance, taking care of the animals, washing them, taking them up the mountains for walks, managing their diets/giving them the herbs and flora of the mountains and timely shearing the wool will ensure the quality of the fibres and in turn preserve the yarns better.\nNext, make sure that after shearing, the fibres are sanded and kept for 5 days in the sun so that the leftover emollient gets stuck to the wool and comes off easily. Then brushing/carding the wool with a clean multi-bristle dog brush will ensure that the fibres are smooth and soft. Fibres of different colors can be mixed during the brushing process to create new shades. This step creates a variety of tones and colors of browns, greys, tonal beiges and everything in between. The mixed fibres can also be dyed with natural dyes later on to make an even more diverse range of hues. The best tones from dyes are achieved through walnut husks, beetroot, onion skins, dried pomegranates and mulberries. These are ideal because they create neutral shades that can be matched with different yarns and made into clothing or other types of textiles. For instance, beetroot and pomegranate skins combined makes an exquisite rusty orange shade that can pair well with the blush tones of beetroot or the ochre tones of pomegranate skins alone.\nThe brushed fibres are supposed to be kept in thin layers and stored in a wooden box made of the poplar tree for 15 days. Once this time is complete then the fibres can be taken out of the box and are ready to be spun into yarn. As a last step, in order to avoid the yarn catching any insects or dust, the women keep the yarn balls in their kitchen above the stove since the smoke from the stove/fireplace keeps away unwanted insects and dust particles. It is possible that the yarns obtain a slight greyish brown tinge because of the smoke but that can be washed off easily."

For black color, the soft green outer shell of walnuts was used and black color was usually used for making caps for females.  For green color, different leaves were used but usually, the fabric was used in its natural color. Pink and yellow colors were given to the fabric by using flowers having petals of the same color. Onions were also used for dying baby pink color. Those dyes were eco-friendly although the process of dying was difficult and laborious but the colors were long lasting."

            "Gilgit Baltistan province is rich in Mineral and natural resources. So, the raw materials found for the production of natural dye are mostly vegetable matter such as seeds, leaves, fruits (Black and white mulberries), flowers (Karaba shot), walnut roots, and barks. Some of them were required to be ground to powder form to facilitate the extraction. Many plant dyes have also been found to have some cosmetic and medicinal properties among the locals."

            "With the advent of synthetic dyes in 1856,  the use of natural dyes gradually fell out of favour because the process was time-consuming and not suitable for mass production.To preserve local materials and wisdom (as well as) to foster creativity and protect the environment, a collaborative workshop was conducted between designers and community members of Barah village of Gilgit Baltistan. Where the community members shared the knowledge of local wisdom as a cultural way of life for sustainable living. Sajjad Hussain, the owner of the studio space, once mentioned that Loha (iron rode) was traditionally used as a mordant/Alum. A mordant is a substance used to set dyes on fabric. Walnut dye was used to dye hair and mulberries have been a part of folk remedies to treat coughs and colds.\nAnother aspect of the workshop was to introduce some new dyeing techniques (resist and dip dye), and make the color palette more vibrant by introducing indigo and pomegranate dye to the local community. Artisans learned to create color textures within the variety of locally available wool yarns and extracted a color palette by determining the various factors(temperature, time, thickness of material) affecting the process of dying. Temperature significantly affected the yield of the natural dyes. Initial dyeing rate increases with the increase of temperature. A longer immersion time will encourage more dye to penetrate the fibre and strengthen the color. Material’s dyeability also varies with its thickness, thicker yarn will take more time to absorb colors than thinner ones."

            "Applying mud plaster is a traditional building practice that involves covering walls with a mixture of mud, clay, sand, and sometimes organic materials like wheat husk or apricot water. The practice of mud plasters was observed at various sites in Baltistan to map varieties of plasters and their longeivity in the event of increased humidity."

            "This technique has been used for centuries across various cultures and regions, including the Himalayas, owing to its numerous benefits. Mud plaster offered natural insulation, helping to regulate indoor temperatures in response to the varying seasons. The thick mud walls, combined with mud plaster, helped to keep homes cool in the scorching summers and warm during the harsh winters. The specific ratios (sand, clay, water, admixture) can vary, but a common starting point might be a mixture of approximately 1 part clay/mud to 1 part sand. The addition of water is adjusted as needed to achieve the desired consistency for application. In some cases, a small amount of organic material like straw might be added, but this can depend on local building traditions. It's crucial to note that these ratios are approximate, and actual practices may vary from one community to another. Local builders often rely on generations of traditional knowledge and hands-on experience to determine the most suitable mud plaster mixture for their specific environmental conditions and building requirements."

            "The practice of applying mud plaster to Himalayan vernacular houses involves the use of natural materials and traditional skills passed down through generations. Clay soil, sourced locally to ensure adaptation to specific regional conditions, serves as the primary component, providing binding properties to the plaster. To enhance structural integrity and prevent cracking, artisans often add straw or other natural fibers to the mixture. Water is used to create a workable plaster by mixing these elements in the right proportions. Some craftsmen may incorporate natural pigments derived from local plants or minerals for color variations or decorative patterns. The application of mud plaster is a hands-on process, requiring skills in mixing, layering, and finishing. Artisans use techniques like troweling or hand application to achieve an even and smooth coat. The layering process, allowing each coat to dry before adding the next, contributes to the strength and durability of the plaster. This skillful practice, deeply rooted in the region's cultural heritage, not only reflects artisanal expertise but also highlights the sustainable nature of these traditional building techniques. Additionally, the knowledge of maintenance and repair techniques ensures the longevity of mud plaster, further connecting communities to their architectural legacy."

            "Conservation process included mapping local wisdom about admixtures (such as *bhoosa made of wheat is better to use than barley, as it is longer and stronger and prevents cracks.\n*Mortar/gaara should be thick for joining stone blocks, and thinner for mud blocks) and variations in plasters that have been tried and tested in recent years for longevity (such as soil wash and white wash. The process of plastering begins by dampening the wall surface. The process involves three layers: the first, a coarse mix of mud and bhoosa; the second, a finer layer with a garmala; and the third, a smooth finish using chikni mitti. Notably, the final coating is less common today. It is suggested that for roofs, mud plaster is preferred over cement due to its repair-friendly nature. Wooden walls are prepared by cleaning, attaching a jali for better adhesion, and then applying plaster. Favorable seasons for plaster work are March-April and October-November. Drying times vary: mud plaster takes 15 days, mud plaster with cement needs 3-4 days, and mud blocks require 7-8 days. These practices highlight the resilience of traditional mud plastering in Himalayan mountain dwellings. > Traditionally, apricot juice was used to increase the strength of mud plaster. Bhoosa also increases the strength of mud plaster. Avoid plaster application or repairs  in the months of January and February as the cold temperature is not feasible for it. Bhoosa and sand should be added in plaster repair for better adhesion.\n//Soil wash: A layer of mixture (2 strained mitti + 1 chikni mitti +  ½ kilo glue +  1 choona) applied on top of exterior plaster for adding color to the plaster. It also acts as a sealant for the plaster. \n//White wash: A layer of mixture (1 strained mitti + 2 chikni mitti + ½ kilo glue + 2 choona) applied on top of interior plasters."
